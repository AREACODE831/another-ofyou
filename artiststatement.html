      This website aims to emulate and reinterpret common shopping malls offline and online. I like to humorously critique the common fashion websites which try to keep their fashion out of the current social movements or global crisis by approaching with sarcasm. Although I am not an ideal slim model with high-fashion poses, I created a fashion website that suggests realistic fashion shopping websites that are marketing to appeal to another ofyou- niether ofyou. 

      <br /><br />

      I got inspired from
      <strong
        ><a href="https://www.zara.com/us/" target="_blank">Zara</a></strong
      >and
      <strong

          >amazondating.com</a

      websites about the concept. It motivated me to bring humor and critical viewpoints to fashion websites, such as taking a photo of zoom fashion(wearing pajama on bottom), pricing ridiculous objects such as expensive chopsticks just because it is a collaboration product, making the sale category that always hooks the customer with the very low price but only XXS and 3xl size left, and showing the emotional fashion editorial images but selling something unexpected at the end of the page. 
<br>
      <br>
The website's design emulates the Zara website; for instance, it emulates sticky titles that follow the viewer’s scrolling, the product names, font style, mixing black and white photos with sentimental or hip images, and embedded Zara store music. But the content is sarcastic and tries to be funny with the current situation and the realities that I encounter, or maybe the viewers are also experiencing. Barbara Kruger’s Another artist - Another exhibition - Another gallery - Another magazine - Another review - Another career - Another life piece’s title motivated me to name the website as Another ofyou. Also, it pronounces similar to neither ofyou. I used Futura font for the title and used close kernings to emulate Zara’s logo and also to give a sense of Kruger vibe.

      <br>
Since my major was photography before changing to DMA, I have photographs from my self-portraiture works and photographs from when I used to help my colleagues as a model. I brought those images and re-edited them with the right atmosphere and emulated fashion websites’ images. Moreover, I recently took some zoom fashion photos from my tiny bed+desk that I am spending 24hrs on for school, for the 'editorial' and 'lifestyle' section. <br>
